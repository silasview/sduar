- 👋 Hi, I’m @sduar
- 👀 I’m interested in learn to code and create digital tools that free us from cognitive load and allow us to focus on the important things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development and python and VBA for automation on my actual work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in automation, ux, data management and analysis, and maybe in the future: artificial intelligence for mobile devices.
